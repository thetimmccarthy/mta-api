The New York MTA makes available an API as well as static data for their transportation systems. Using both of these, I built an application that finds upcoming trains from a given station, with optionality to select 'favorite' stations to add to your dashboard.

The frontend is built using React, though is very much still a work in progress. The backend is written in Python and uses the Flask framework. 

I also built a graph data structure that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between two given subway stops.
