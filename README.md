I take the train to Connecticut throughout the week, first riding the subway to get to the station for the commuter rail. 

This Flask + Twilio + MTA api application sends via text a list of upcoming subway trains at a given station. 

Text your station to the number and receive the list of trains!

Currently only works for northbound trains on the 4/5/6 line, soon to be expanded
